I want to write a program using Rust.But there is no suitable GUI library.

GUI libraries with large compiled files are not on my consider.

I used the "Druid" library and felt like I was pitting my wits against it.

So I want to write one myself. But my rust skills are only beginner level, so in early alpha releases this library will be licensed under GLWTPL until I consider it a qualifying open source repository.

This repository is still in the starting state, and the API and program structure may be changed at any time. Please do not officially use it for the time being !!!
